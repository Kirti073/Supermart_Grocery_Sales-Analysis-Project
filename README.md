# Supermart_Grocery_Sales-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes sales data from a fictional grocery store, **Supermart**, using various machine learning models to predict sales performance. The primary goal is to explore the dataset, engineer relevant features, and evaluate the effectiveness of different predictive models.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and remove duplicates to ensure data quality.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as interaction terms, time-based features, and customer averages to enhance the model's predictive power.
3. **Modeling**: Implement and evaluate three machine learning models: **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

### Findings:
- **Linear Regression** outperformed the other models with the lowest MSE and highest R² value, making it the most suitable model for this dataset.

### Tools Used:
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Seaborn** for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

This project provides insights into sales data and demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in retail analytics.
